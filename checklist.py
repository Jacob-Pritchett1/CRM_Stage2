#This file is for a checklist of items I am wanting to accomplish. 

#1. Build a feature that allows a User to create a company. When a user creates a company, they should be able to add the information and save it. It will then be tied to that user. 
#2. Build a feature that allows a user to access all of the companies they have added.
